				<h2>Test7</h2>
				<p>Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of
				the western spiral arm of the Galaxy lies a small unregarded yellow
				sun.
				Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety-­‐two million miles is an
				utterly insignificant little blue green planet whose ape-­‐descended life
				forms are so amazingly primitive that they still think digital watches
				are a pretty neat idea.
				This planet has ʹ or rather had ʹ a problem, which was this: most
				of the people on it were unhappy for pretty much of the time. Many
				solutions were suggested for this problem, but most of these were
				largely concerned with the movements of small green pieces of paper,
				which is odd because on the whole it wasn't the small green pieces of
				paper that were unhappy.
				And so the problem remained; lots of the people were mean, and
				most of them were miserable, even the ones with digital watches.
				Many were increasingly of the opinion that they'd all made a big
				mistake in coming down from the trees in the first place. And some
				said that even the trees had been a bad move, and that no one should
				ever have left the oceans.
				And then, one Thursday, nearly two thousand years after one man
				had been nailed to a tree for saying how great it would be to be nice
				to people for a change, one girl sitting on her own in a small cafe in
				Rickmansworth suddenly realized what it was that had been going
				wrong all this time, and she finally knew how the world could be
				made a good and happy place. This time it was right, it would work,
				and no one would have to get nailed to anything.
				Sadly, however, before she could get to a phone to tell anyone
				about it, a terribly stupid catastrophe occurred, and the idea was lost
				forever.
				This is not her story.
				But it is the story of that terrible stupid catastrophe and some of its
				consequences.
				It is also the story of a book, a book called The Hitch Hiker's Guide
				to the Galaxy ʹ not an Earth book, never published on Earth, and until
				the terrible catastrophe occurred, never seen or heard of by any
				Earthman.
				Nevertheless, a wholly remarkable book.
				In fact it was probably the most remarkable book ever to come out
				of the great publishing houses of Ursa Minor ʹ of which no Earthman
				had ever heard either.
				Not only is it a wholly remarkable book, it is also a highly successful
				one ʹ more popular than the Celestial Home Care Omnibus, better
				selling than Fifty More Things to do in Zero Gravity, and more
				controversial than Oolon Colluphid's trilogy of philosophical
				blockbusters Where God Went Wrong, Some More of God's Greatest
				Mistakes and Who is this God Person Anyway?
				In many of the more relaxed civilizations on the Outer Eastern Rim
				of the Galaxy, the Hitch Hiker's Guide has already supplanted the
				great Encyclopedia Galactica as the standard repository of all
				knowledge and wisdom, for though it has many omissions and
				contains much that is apocryphal, or at least wildly inaccurate, it
				scores over the older, more pedestrian work in two important
				respects.
				First, it is slightly cheaper; and secondly it has the words DON'T
				PANIC inscribed in large friendly letters on its cover.
				But the story of this terrible, stupid Thursday, the story of its
				extraordinary consequences, and the story of how these
				consequences are inextricably intertwined with this remarkable book
				begins very simply.
				It begins with a house.</p>
